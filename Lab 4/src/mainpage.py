@subsection intro Introduction
In this lab interrupts were utilized to measure the step response of a RC circuit. The main file read from the
pins and converted the analog signal to digital and printed to the serial port. To print, a queue was used with a
buffer size of 1000.

Find more information regarding the files:
main.py and task_share.py.

A plot file was also created to run the step response from any IDE. Find more
information at: plot_agena_chiu.py.
