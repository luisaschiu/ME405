@subsection intro Introduction
In this lab a motor, encoder, and controller drivers were initialized in the main file. The main file also included
functions that act as tasks and were cooperatively ran using a multitasking system. In order to do so a share task
and non-blocking print task was created.

Find more information regarding the drivers at: 
motor_agena_chiu.MotorDriver, encoder_agena_chiu.EncoderDriver,
controller_agena_chiu.ControllerDriver.

Find more information regarding the other files on the Nucleo at:
main.py, cotask.py, task_share.py, and print_task.py.

A plot file was also created to run the step response from any IDE. Find more
information at: plot_agena_chiu.py.
